When you're cycling or running without a power meter, use heart rate to compute training load score. Custom formula for Trimp Zonal Points which gives the same result as hrTSS from Training Peaks.

In Golden Cheetah, click on Tools > Options > Athlete > heartrate zones. Use the following for HR zones and Trimp Zonal Points:

HR Zone 1 >>> 0-80% LTHR >>> 0.66 Trimp k
HR Zone 2 >>> 81-89% LTHR >>> 0.92 Trimp k
HR Zone 3 >>> 90-93% LTHR >>> 1.17 Trimp k
HR Zone 4 >>> 94-99% LTHR >>> 1.33 Trimp k
HR Zone 5 >>> 100+% LTHR >>> 2.00 Trimp k

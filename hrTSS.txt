Heart rate based training load score. Custom formula for Trimp Zonal Points.

Click on Tools > Options > Athlete > heartrate zones. Use the following for HR zones and Trimp Zonal Points:

HR Zone 1 >>> 0-80% LTHR >>> 0.66 Trimp k
HR Zone 2 >>> 81-89% LTHR >>> 0.92 Trimp k
HR Zone 3 >>> 90-93% LTHR >>> 1.17 Trimp k
HR Zone 4 >>> 94-99% LTHR >>> 1.33 Trimp k
HR Zone 5 >>> 100+% LTHR >>> 2.00 Trimp k




To create a user defined metric in Golden Cheetah called myTSS that will be TSS if it is available or Trimp Zonal Points otherwise. 
  
Click on Tools > Options > Metrics > Custom > + (Plus symbol at the bottom)

Set the type to total and percision to 0

Formula to copy and paste:
{ 
value { BikeStress ? BikeStress : TRIMP_Zonal_Points; } 
}

Then go to Tools > Options > Metrics > Summary and add myTSS so it shows up on each activity. You can now use myTSS in a PMC chart instead of Trimp Points or TSS.

<b>Custom metrics & trend charts for Golden Cheetah 3.5+ for analyzing cycling workouts & races</b><br/>
<h3>Text files are instructions on how I did things</h3>
<b>golden cheetah 3-5 upgrade.txt</b> - My notes from installing Golden Cheetah 3.5 & Python on Windows 10. Including which Python libraries I loaded to make the charts work<br/>
<b>hrTSS.txt</b> - Custom formula for Trimp Zonal Points which gives the same result as hrTSS from Training Peaks<br/>
<b>Sweet Spot Metric.txt</b> - Create a custom metric that shows time spent riding in "Sweet Spot"<br/>
<br/>
<h3>The *.gchart files are trends charts that can be imported straight into Golden Cheetah</h3>
<b>PMC.ghcart</b> - CTL, ATL, & TSB trend chart using TSS when available otherwise Trimp Zonal Points as data source for each activity<br/>
<b>Performance Tracker.gchart</b> - CTL and best power efforts (1sec, 10sec, 1min, 5min, 10min, 20min) shown as a trend chart month-over-month<br/>
<b>Power Estimates.gchart</b> - FTP setting, FTP estimate, 30 minute best efforts, 20 minute * 0.95 best efforts, VO2Max estimate, W' estimate. The purpose is that if you can't get your 30 minute best effort or 20 minute * 0.95 best effort near your FTP setting, the setting is too high. If your bests are above the FTP setting, the setting is too low.<br/>

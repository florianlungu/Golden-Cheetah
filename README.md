# Golden-Cheetah-charts
<b>Custom metrics & trend charts for Golden Cheetah 3.5+</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>The *.gchart files can be imported straight into Golden Cheetah</b><br/>
Monthly Bests.ghcart - Current month best efforts (5sec, 10sec, 1min, 5min, 10min, 20min)<br/>
PMC.ghcart - <br/>
Performance Tracker.gchart - <br/>
Power Estimates.gcharts - FTP setting, FTP estimate, 30 & 45 minute best efforts, VO2Max estimate, W' estimate. The purpose is that if you can't get your 30 & 45 minute best effort near your FTP setting, the setting is too high. If your bests are above the FTP setting, the setting is too low.<br/>

Use the following to create a custom metric that shows time spent riding in "Sweet Spot"

Symbol: Time_In_Sweet_Spot
Name: Time in Sweet Spot
Description: Time spent riding in sweet spot
Precision: 0
Time: True
Units: seconds


Formula:
{
    # only calculate for rides containing power
    relevant { Data contains "P"; }

    # initialise aggregating variables
    init { ssTime <- 0; }

    # for each sample, hopefully your device records data every second
    sample { 		 
 		ssTime <- (POWER >= (config(ftp)*0.84)-1 && POWER <= (config(ftp)*0.97)+1) ? 
					ssTime+1 : ssTime ;
    }

    # calculate metric value at end
    value { ssTime; }
}

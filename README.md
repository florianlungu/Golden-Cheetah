# Golden-Cheetah-charts
<h1>Custom metrics & trend charts for Golden Cheetah 3.5+ to analyze cycling workouts & races</h1><br/>
<br/>
<b>Text files are instructions on how I did things</b><br/>
golden cheetah 3-5 upgrade.txt - My notes from installing Golden Cheetah 3.5 & Python on Windows 10. Including which Python libraries I loaded to make the charts work<br/>
hrTSS.txt - Custom formula for Trimp Zonal Points which gives the same result as hrTSS from Training Peaks<br/>
Sweet Spot Metric.txt - Create a custom metric that shows time spent riding in "Sweet Spot"<br/>
<br/>
<b>The *.gchart files can be imported straight into Golden Cheetah</b><br/>
Monthly Bests.ghcart - Current month best efforts (5sec, 10sec, 1min, 5min, 10min, 20min)<br/>
PMC.ghcart - <br/>
Performance Tracker.gchart - <br/>
Power Estimates.gcharts - FTP setting, FTP estimate, 30 minute best efforts, 20 minute * 0.95 best efforts, VO2Max estimate, W' estimate. The purpose is that if you can't get your 30 minute best effort or 20 minute * 0.95 best effort near your FTP setting, the setting is too high. If your bests are above the FTP setting, the setting is too low.<br/>
